== MoreValidators

A compilation of simple validators we need in most Rails apps.
This gem plugin only works with Rails 3 / ActiveModel.

== Examples

Validation of an email address :

  class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
    validates :my_email_field, :email => true
  end

Validation of an URL :

  class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
    validates :my_url_field, :url => true
  end

== Installation

As a gem in your app's Gemfile :

  gem 'more_validators'

== Tests

If you wanna run the tests :

  rake spec
